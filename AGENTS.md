# Contribution notes
- Keep documentation concise and focused on accessibility/performance details that affect blind TalkBack users.
- In docs, explicitly describe MBROLA as the Persian fallback path and stress rapid speech requirements for Google TalkBack.
- Mention the ONNX Persian path (`elnaz.onnx`) clearly: preload in `FaTts.Load(...)`, synthesize in `FaTts.synth(...)`, convert to PCM16, then stream through the existing callback queue.
- Prefer Markdown bullet lists for features, behaviors, and checklists.
- For DualTts optimizations, prioritize concrete low-latency tactics:
  - preloading model/voice assets,
  - buffer reuse,
  - synthesis thread priority tuning,
  - hot-path metadata caching,
  - immediate chunk streaming to keep TalkBack speech synchronized with focus movement.
