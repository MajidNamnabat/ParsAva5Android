# Contribution notes
- Keep documentation concise and focus on accessibility and performance details that impact blind TalkBack users.
- When editing docs, call out MBROLA’s role in Persian synthesis and emphasize the importance of rapid speech for Google TalkBack use.
- Prefer Markdown lists for describing features and behaviors.
- When proposing DualTts optimizations, favor concrete, low-latency tactics (preloading, buffer reuse, thread priority tuning) and describe how they help TalkBack users stay in sync with the screen.
